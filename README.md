# Montreal Apartment Craigslist Scraper

Built a web scraper to gather Montreal apartment listings data from Craigslist. 

Ran exploratory analysis with pandas / seaborn. 

Dataset gathered is quite underwhelming: only 90 unique listings. Lots of duplicates (Craiglist spammers!) and incomplete listings. Little to no empirical value - did not fully clean the data set, especially with regards to neighborhoods.

Good learning experience re: building a scraper with python and playing around with pandas!
